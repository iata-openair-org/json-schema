Open Air JSON schema library has been designed by the Open API group, as the source of standard data definition in JSON schema format.\n\nFor the consistency of data definition in the industry proprietary APIs, the IATA Open API working group has designed the procedure and specification to derive the JSON schema library from AIDM integrated model under the governance view, including all standard data entities and their definition. \n\n## AIDM\nIATA maintains the [Airline Industry standard Data Model (AIDM)](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/workgroups/passenger-standards-conference/architecture-technology-strategy/industry-data-model/), under the governance of [Change Management Group](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/workgroups/passenger-standards-conference/architecture-technology-strategy/#tab-1).\nThis Open Air JSON schema library represents the standard data model under the governance view of AIDM. \n\n## Consumption Guide\n\nDevelopers should read the [JSON schema library consumption guide](https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AIDM/pages/588873747/IATA+Open+Air+JSON+Library+Consumption+Guide) to understand how to use the standard schema objects in the proprietary API design and achieve the IATA Open Air certification.",
